# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake News Detector for WhatsApp & YouTube

This is a simple yet powerful **Streamlit web application** that helps users verify whether the content from a **news article URL** (often shared on WhatsApp, Telegram, or Facebook) might be **fake or misleading**. It does this by analyzing the **sentiment** (positive or negative) of the content using a **pre-trained AI model from Hugging Face**.

> ⚠️ **YouTube links are detected but not supported for text extraction in this version.**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Fake news can spread quickly through social media and messaging platforms. This tool aims to give users an easy way to **check the tone** (positive or negative sentiment) of a news article before trusting or sharing it.

Although this doesn't *directly* detect if a news article is fake, it gives **basic insight** into the article’s nature using AI-powered sentiment analysis.

---

## 🖥️ How the App Works

1. **User pastes a link** to a news article or YouTube video.
2. If it’s a **news article**:
   - The app extracts the text from the link using the `newspaper3k` library.
   - Then it **cleans and limits** the content to 512 words.
   - It sends this content to a **pre-trained BERT model** that predicts if the sentiment is `POSITIVE` or `NEGATIVE`.
   - The app shows:
     - Extracted Text (preview)
     - Result (Positive or Negative)
     - Confidence Score (e.g., 98.75%)
3. If it’s a **YouTube link**:
   - The app shows a warning that text extraction from YouTube is **not supported** in this version.

## ✨ Features

- 📰 **Supports any public news article link**
- 📊 **Performs sentiment analysis** using Hugging Face's `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`
- 💬 Shows **confidence score** of prediction
- 🚫 **Detects but skips YouTube links**
- 📋 **Previews the extracted content**
- 🧠 **Lightweight and fast** (thanks to Streamlit + model caching)

## 📦 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your system.

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above installed
- Git (optional but helpful)
- Internet connection (to load the AI model)

---

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detector.git
cd fake-news-detector
````

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Required Packages

If you have a `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers newspaper3k
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
```

---

### 🏃 Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

## 🔍 Sample Output

### Input:

```
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66700000
```

### Output:

* **Extracted Title**: "Tensions Rise Between Countries X and Y"
* **Result**: **NEGATIVE**
* **Confidence Score**: 96.21%

> 🧠 A negative sentiment doesn't always mean "fake", but it may indicate bias, negativity, or alarming content — useful as a red flag.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* ❌ **YouTube links** are not processed (transcript/audio analysis not yet included).
* 🤖 The current AI model does **not detect fake news directly** — it does sentiment analysis (used here as a proxy).
* 🌐 May fail on **paywalled** or **JavaScript-heavy** websites.
* 🔣 Supports only **English language articles**.

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for the next version:

* ✅ Add support for **YouTube transcript extraction** (using `youtube-transcript-api`)
* 🔬 Train or use a real **fake news detection model**
* 🌐 Multi-language support (Telugu, Hindi, etc.)
* 📈 Add a **dashboard** to visualize previous scans
* ☁️ Deploy to **Streamlit Cloud** or **Hugging Face Spaces**
